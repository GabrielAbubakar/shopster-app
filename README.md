## Overview:

- Shopster is an eCommerce app using redux for state management
- Products can be filtered using the navigation according to categories
- Every product has an unique id and is accesible using routing.
- The final cart page dispatches actions to the state to update number of items in the cart and their quantities
- The different pages of the application use Server Side Rendering, for the home page, Static Site Genration for the product pages and Client side fetching for the cart checkout.

For detailed stack details and requirements for local deployment of the application check the [Wiki](https://github.com/GabrielAbubakar/shopster-app/wiki)
